### How to use

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **r3f** property to the parent component.

```jsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello !</h1>
      {/* Simply add the r3f prop to the parent component -> */}
      <MeshComponent r3f />
    </>
  )
}

export default Page
```

### next-transpile-modules

We override the module by transpiling only the three/examples/jsm to build faster and also to prevent JavaScript heap out of memory errors.
If you have any issue related to transpilation you might need to tweak or remove the "match" condition in next.config.js
